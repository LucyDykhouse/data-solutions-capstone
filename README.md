Assessing the factors that affect water quality

### Challenge:
What properties are most important to consider when determining water quality? Are there threshold property values above which water is not considered potable?

### Purpose:
Access to potable water is both a necessity for life and a basic human right; however, the vast majority of new and existing water sources are unfit for consumption. Determining which factors have the greatest effect on a water source's potability will provide people with concrete measures of the quality of their water. Additionally, understanding the importance of water properties as they relate to water quality will allow for a better understanding of how the water quality can be improved, which has significant health and development implications.

### Tech Stack:
For cleaning, wrangling, and interacting with data: Numpy, Pandas  
For visualization: Matplotlib/Seaborn (basic histograms), Plotly (interactive scatterplots)  
For statistical analyses: Sklearn

### Data Sources
Kaggle water quality dataset  
Data World water quality csv

### Acceptance Criteria
As a user, I should be able to infer which factors most affect water quality using data visualizations.  
As a user, I should be able to see various property values that act as thresholds for whether water is potable using data visualizations.  
As a user, I should be able to tell which factors most affect water quality using quantitative values from univariate/multivariate regressions.
