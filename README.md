**Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing.ipynb** : Implements logistic regression and analyzes outputs  

**hypothesis_dashboard.py** : generates interactive dashboard to display hypothesis testing results  
**requirements.txt** : lists packages and versions installed  

## Acceptance Criteria
As a user, I should be able to infer which factors most affect water quality using data visualizations.  
As a user, I should be able to see various property values that act as thresholds for whether water is potable using data visualizations.  
As a user, I should be able to tell which factors most affect water quality using quantitative values from univariate/multivariate regressions.
